# Legacy ACM Club Website

This site can be viewed [HERE](https://timparrish.github.io/legacy_acm_club_website/)

This is a HTML/CSS website I created for a school club while serving as the webmaster for the Montana State University chapter. I created this site to build a very simple, low maintenance webpage for the club that provides students with resources that help further their skills in Computer Science. My expectation is that future students who volunteer their time to maintain this will not have much (if any) experience with web programming and therefore, no advanced HTML or CSS was used. I maintained this site on the school server [cs.montana.edu/acm](https://www.cs.montana.edu/acm/) for a year after I built it and passed it on to the next webmaster in Summer 2019. 

This is posted here to archive it for archival purposes. To honor copyrights, I have removed the logo and the group photo that were once on this site and replaced them with placeholders. While it does not show the logo anymore, the website nav-bar and color scheme was designed to complement the ACM logo. 

I found a great website for adding placeholders to a project and avoid copyright problems, [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/) gives you an API to get placeholder images at your specified dimensions. 

The wallpaper derived is from [toptal.com](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/), formerly subtlepatterns.com.
